# Introducci√≥n a Machine Learning

**Definition**: **machine learning** is the subfield of computer science that gives "computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed".

## How it works?

You have a dataser of images of animales such as cats and dogs, and you want to have a sofware that can recognize and differentiate them.
First thing: interpret the images as a set of features sets. Example
- Does the image show the animal's eyes?
- What is their size?
- Does it have ears?
- What about a tail?
- How many legs?
- Does it have wings?

Prior to machine larning, each image would be transformed to a vector of features. 
Then, we have to write down some rules or methods in order to get computers to be intelligent and detect de animales. But, it was a failure. It needed a lot of rules, highly dependent on the current dataset, and not generalized enough to detect out-of-sample cases. This is when machine learning entered the scene.
Using machine learning allows us to build a model that looks at all the features sets and their corresponding type of animals, and learn it lt learns the pattern of each animal. It is a moder built by machine learning algorithms. It detects without explicitly being programmed to do so.
Machine learnings algorithms, inspired by the human learning process, iteratively learn from data, and allow computers to find hidden insights.

## Major machine learning techniques

- Regression / estimation
    - Predicting continuous values: predicting things like the price of a house based on its characteristics, or to estimate the Co2 emission from a car engine.
- Classification
    - It is used for predicting the class or category of a case, for example, if a cell is bening or malignant, or whether or not a customer will churn.
- Clustering
    Clustering groups of similar cases, for example, can find similar patients, or can be used for customers segmentation in banking field.
- Associations
    - It is used for finding items or events that often co-occur, for example, grocery items that are usually bought together by a particular customer.
- Anomaly detection
    - It is used to discover abnormal and unusual cases, for example, it is used for credit card fraud detection.
- Sequence mining
    - It is used for predicting the next event, for instance, the click-stream in websites.
- Dimension reduction
    - It is used to reduce the size data.
- Recommendation system
    - This associates people's preferences with others who have similar tastes, and recommends new items to them, such as books or movies.

## Difference betweeen artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning

All tries to make computers inteliggent in order to mimic the cognitive functions of humas. Artifical intelligence is a general field with a broad scope including: 
- Computer vision
- Language processing
- Creativity
- Summarization

- Al componentes
    - Computer vision
    - Language processing
    - Creativity
    - Etc

- Machine learning
    - Branch of AI that covers the statistical part of artificial intelligence. It teaches the computer to solve problems by looking ad hundreds or thousands of examples, learning from them, and the using that experience to solve the same problem in new situations .
    - Classification
    - Clustering
    - Neural network
    - Etc.

- Revolution in ML
    - Where computers can actually learn and make intelligent desisions on the road.
    - Deep learning
